Title: A Racket Perspective on Research, Education, and Production

Abstract:

It's natural to think of research, education, and production as having
competing goals. In programming-language design, for example, the needs
of beginning students can differ greatly from the needs of practicing
programmers, while research may explore ideas that are not yet worked
out enough for either audience. With a shift in perspective, however,
we can not only balance these goals but have them reinforce each other.
The developers of Racket have integrated all three directions from the
beginning (and now for 24 years). We'll talk about opportunities,
challenges, results, and outlook based on that experience.
